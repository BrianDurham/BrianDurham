# Brian Durham

Backend developer and Linux enthusiast focused on automation, scripting, and practical tooling.  
I enjoy building small, self-contained utilities – the kind that make systems more efficient or reveal what's really happening under the hood.

### 🔧 Areas of interest
- Python / Bash scripting  
- Linux system administration  
- Automation and orchestration (Ansible, cron, rsync)  
- Lightweight web tools (Flask, Grav, static generation)  
- Distributed computing and BOINC projects  

### 🗂️ Selected work
- [Password Generator GUI](https://github.com/BrianDurham/gen-password)) – minimal Tkinter tool using Python’s `secrets` module  
- [Misc utilities](#) – various scripts for system checks, stats gathering, and automation (more coming soon)

### ☕ Support my projects
